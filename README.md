# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM


## Description:


This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The goal is to accurately predict future stock prices based on historical data, leveraging the sequential nature of financial data.

## Dataset:
Description: The dataset consists of historical stock prices, including open, high, low, close, and volume information. 
It is used to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

## Modeling Approach:
The project employs an LSTM model to capture the temporal dependencies in the stock price data. Key steps include:

### Data Preprocessing:
Normalization of the data to ensure consistent scaling.
Creating time series sequences for LSTM input, where each sequence is used to predict the next stock price.

### Model Architecture:

Input Layer: Accepts the preprocessed time series data.
LSTM Layers: Captures the temporal dependencies.
Dense Layer: Outputs the final stock price prediction.

### Training:

The model is trained on a portion of the historical data while validating on a separate validation set.
The training process involves optimizing the loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) to minimize prediction errors.

### Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices are generated to assess the model's accuracy.
## Results:
### Training Results: 
The model was trained over 40 epochs, and the loss decreased steadily, indicating that the model learned from the data.
### Predictions: 
The model's predictions on the test set show a close alignment with the actual stock prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LSTM approach.
### Training Loss Curve: 
A plot showing the reduction in loss over time during training.
### Prediction Plot: 
A comparison of predicted vs. actual stock prices over the test period.
